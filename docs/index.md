## User Stories

“As a new trader I really want a platform that uses live, real market data to allow me to set up
fake trades and test my strategy. I would like some tools that allow me to see a history of
what im doing, and a some data that helps me analyze whether my strategies are working.”

I'm sure im not the only day trader who wants to create and tweak new strategies, the ability to test
those strategies and have some tools to analYze them is invaluable.

“As a day trader I wonder how effective the trades I have initiated have been. I would like to see
a history of the trades I have made, the price I purchased the commodity for, how much it sold for, 
the date and time this transaction occurred, and the profit margins of that particular trade, shown 
both in dollars, and a percentage of the total investment. With these tools I wish to 
create, test, and evaluate new strategies, in a real or simulated environment.”
