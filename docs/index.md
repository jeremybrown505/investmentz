#Investmentz

## Introduction
Investmentz is an android based platform that will allow its users to set up an account, and start 
making bitcoin trades using fake money to develop some trading strategies, and provides some basic
tools to help analyze the effectiveness of those strategies. Eventually I plan to implement the ability 
to import your real money trades into the app and keep track and analyze those as well.
